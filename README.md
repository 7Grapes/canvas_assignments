# canvas_assignments
a script meant for keeping track of canvas assignments

#next steps

assignments that are pulled from canvas must be sorted in order or priority. Easy assignmnets can be comfortably set aside for the last day but larger projects should be pushed towards the top of the stack.
At the moment they are only sorted by date.
